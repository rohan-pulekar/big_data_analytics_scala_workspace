Mr. Rubio — who in recent days has focused on his home state, which he must win in its March 15 primary if he hopes to continue his campaign — made a detour to Puerto Rico on Saturday, campaigning in San Juan and holding a news conference, mostly in Spanish, in a last-minute push to win the primary. Puerto Rico, which has roughly 3.7 million residents, could help Mr. Rubio in his home state’s primary. More than one million Puerto Ricans live in Florida, concentrated most heavily around Orlando, and many were closely watching their island’s contest Sunday. Puerto Rico is embroiled in a debt crisis, with the territory facing a deficit of more than $70 billion.
